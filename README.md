# Lumaro — Open-source Food Nutrition Analyzer (PWA)

Lumaro is a free, open-source progressive web app that analyzes food nutrition from a photo using **Gemini Vision**.  
Most existing apps are paid and still not fully accurate, so Lumaro aims to provide a simple, privacy-friendly, local-first alternative.
